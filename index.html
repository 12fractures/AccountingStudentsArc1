                <p> Name: Ilaiza Mae M. Cerillo</p>
                <p> Age: 19 years old</p>
                <p> Future Dream Job: Civil Engineer, Accountant, Teacher, Chef, Seawoman</p>
                <hr>
                <p class="test3">I am Ilaiza, and I was a STEM student before I enter college as a freshman. When I was a senior high school student, I was always thinking about where the path I will carry in the future. I don't like business totally because I want to be an engineer student someday but God has a better plan for me. He did not give me the opportunity to be an engineer. But on the other hand, he puts me to the opportunity to be an accountant student. I don't have any insights in this course but I am hardly trying to love and accept this forever.</p>
                <p class="test3">My future plans is to be a Certified Management Accountant and travel abroad. I want to work outside of my country. And also I want to make a business by my own. This business is a cafe which is a business that will be beneficial for students and workers or employees. If there is a man that is destined to be mine "Edi go, tanggap agad". But in fact, I want to focus on myself for now and continue  reaching my goals in life. It was hard to be in a relationship nowadays, it was like an accounting. You can't be assured if you can't see the fact.</p>
                <p class="test3">If you want to achieve something in life just be go with the flow and trust the process. God has always a great plan for us. I know that all of us will be successful someday. And I hope that if you reach your goals do not forget to thank all the people helps you. "Ganbatte ne! Mina-San".</p>
